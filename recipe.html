            <h3>Ingredients:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup sugar</li>
                <li>1/3 cup water</li>
                <li>2 (14oz) cans sweet condensed milk</li>
                <li>28oz whole milk (use the sweet condensed milk can to measure)</li>
                <li>4 eggs</li>
                <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375 degrees.</li>
                <li>In a saucepan, melt the sugar over medium-high heat. After about 10 minutes, once it's golden brown, add the water and let it cook, stirring lightly, until it thickens a bit.</li>
                <li>Pour the caramel into a 10-inch Angel Food Pan and swirl it to cover the bottom and sides. Let it sit for a few minutes so it hardens. It is important that the caramel firms before you add the flan mixture so they don't mix together.</li>
                <li>Add the sweet condensed milk, milk, eggs, and vanilla extract to a large blender jar. Blend for a few minutes until smooth. (If you can't fit all the ingredients, divide them equally into 2 batches!)</li>
                <li>Pour the flan mixture into the Angel Food Pan and cover with foil.</li>
                <li>Fill a large baking pan (a lasagna dish works great!) halfway through with water and place the Angel Food Pan in it.</li>
                <li>Bring it to the oven and bake it in bain-marie for 1 hour and 30 minutes or until the top is golden brown. I like to wiggle the pan a bit to see if it's still liquidy. Sometimes I have to leave it for an extra 15 minutes. You can also insert a cake tester to check. It should come out clean or almost clean.</li>
                <li>Let the flan cool and transfer it to the fridge to cool overnight.</li>
                <li>To remove the flan from the mold, just run a knife along the sides and then carefully flip it onto a serving plate.</li>
            </ol>
